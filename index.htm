            diverse sectors like Media, B2B, Financial services, Healthcare, and Social Innovation. My expertise extends
            broadly within the digital product development and over the years I have gained a good understanding of
            neighboring fields like Technical Engineering, Business Development, Market Research and Branding. Closest
            to my heart though, is creating user experiences that resonates with the end users through Service Design
            and Design Thinking processes.
